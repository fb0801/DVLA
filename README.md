# DVLA
<h3>Description:</h3>
Mini web application prototype, which makes it easier to add details to a driver or for a driver to view their own data. Currently a driver can view their driving details through this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence">website</a>. And have to wait weeks or months to see if they have or have not been given penalty points and a letter, which can be very scary for a driver new or even experienced. This prototype would reduce the amount of paper the DVLA, police forces and other parties would need, the amount of time a driver would have to wait for their licence to be returned to them for points to be added, avoid the licence getting lost or forgotton due to human error as well as reduce costs.
