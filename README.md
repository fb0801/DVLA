# DVLA
<h3>Description:</h3>
Mini web application prototype, which makes it easier to add details to a driver or for a driver to view their own data. Currently a driver can view their driving details through this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence">website</a>. And have to wait weeks or months to see if they have or have not been given penalty points and a letter, which can be very scary for a driver new or even experienced. This prototype would reduce the amount of paper the DVLA, police forces and other parties would need, the amount of time a driver would have to wait for their licence to be returned to them for points to be added and avoid the licence getting lost or forgotton due to human error.
